# 📘 Big Data Analytics Lab (PySpark)

This repository contains my lab work and assignments for the **Big Data Analytics** course.  
The focus of this lab is to gain hands-on experience with **PySpark** for large-scale data processing, transformation, and analysis.

## 🚀 Overview

Big Data Analytics is about handling, processing, and analyzing massive datasets that traditional tools cannot manage efficiently.  
Using **Apache Spark** (via PySpark), this lab explores key concepts of distributed data processing and analytics in a scalable environment.
